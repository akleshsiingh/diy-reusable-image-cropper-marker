## Code is self contained and featture can be easily migrated to any other js framework.

Last weekend i got the idea to create something to just quote price of different articles in one single image. So Just take one single image and mark different articles with rectangle and quote their price (In progress).
After that their was no stopping me, i jumped to code and started shaping my little idea.

i create a simple project with angular cli without any additional routing and modules. i wanted to keep it as simple as it can be but i also wanted to make it as reusable as it can be. So i finally decided to make this functionality within a directive.

It would be much better to try it yourself at below live url.
